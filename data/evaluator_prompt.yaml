scoring_rules:
  - "Score 0-100 based on overlap between candidate skills and STATED job requirements"
  - "fit_bucket: strong (70+), moderate (55-69), weak (40-54), poor (<40)"
  - "recommendation: apply (60+), maybe (45-59), skip (<45)"
  - "If the description is a generic company blurb with no specific job requirements, treat it as title-only"
  - "TITLE-ONLY or THIN DESCRIPTION: If the job has no description or only a brief/generic snippet with no specific requirements listed, cap the score at 50 maximum. Note \"limited info — title-only assessment\" in reasoning. Only match on what the title explicitly indicates (e.g., \"Bioanalytical Scientist\" matches bioanalytical domain, but do NOT infer specific techniques). IMPORTANT: for domain_match, use the format \"[Thin JD] <domain inferred from title only>\" — never infer techniques or platforms from the candidate profile when the description is thin or generic."
  - "CMC LEADERSHIP PENALTY: If the role's PRIMARY competency is CMC program leadership — including BLA/NDA Module 3 authoring, PPQ/process validation oversight, DS/DP/stability program leadership, CDMO management, or commercial manufacturing strategy — cap the score at 35 regardless of domain keyword overlap (e.g., AAV, gene therapy). The candidate is a bioanalytical specialist with no demonstrated CMC program leadership, BLA authorship, or manufacturing oversight. Keyword overlap alone does not justify a higher score."
